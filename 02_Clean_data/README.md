# Clean Data

The data files in this folder contains all the data generated through the processing and analysis of the raw data. The data files are:

- `00_event_timestamps_arrays_list.pkl` - This file contains all the timestamps for each event. This .pkl file can be imported as a list of arrays where each array contains the index of wehre activity is detected. This lsit is the same length and order as the `00_recording_event_times_labels.csv` file and can be added as a column to ease processing in a dataframe format. This file has to be imported using the pickle package.


- `00_recording_event_times_labels.csv` - This is a .csv file contains all the required infrormtion from the raw data about each separate timeseries. Each row represents a behavioural event at a certain unit. With the following columns:
  - **order**: This indicates which behaviour was executed first, second, third, etc. in the same recording session.
  - **start_time**: This indicates the time at which the event started. This is as the sampling rate of the recording where 20 000 samples are taken per second.
  - **end_time**: This indicates the time at which the event ended. This is as the sampling rate of the recording where 20 000 samples are taken per second.
  - **collection_key**: This is the name of the recording session as it was in the raw data.
  - **subject**: This is the label of the mouse of which the recording was done.
  - **behavior_label**: This is the type of behaviour that was observed during the recording event.
  - **units**: This is the unit at which the behaviour was observed. This is a string of the unit name.


- `00_timestamps_arrays_list.pkl` - This file contains a list of arrays with all the timestamps captured during a recording session. It is the same inforamtion as the `.timestamps_var` attribute in the raw data. The order and length of this list is the same as the `00_recording_event_times_labels.csv` file and can be added as a column to ease processing in a dataframe format. This file has to be imported using the pickle package.


- *`01_dtw_distance_matrix.npy` - This file is too large to be uploaded to github. It can be downloaded [HERE](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/q61v8jj0i37oupf9qt5dg/01_dtw_distance_matrix.npy?rlkey=9uhquk7s2cq3dfogcv8wifk9u&dl=0) from a DropBox link. It is a 5gb file. It is the distance matrix generated by the DTW algorithm. It is used to generate the cluster relation dataframe in this folder.* This file ahs to be imported using the numpy package.


- `02_recording_event_times_labels_binary_clustered.csv` - This .csv file contains a cluster column added to the `00_recording_event_times_labels.csv` file. Each row represents a behavioural event that was recorded at a certain unit. The .csv file has the folowing columns:
  - **order**: This indicates which behaviour was executed first, second, third, etc. in the same recording session.
  - **start_time**: This indicates the time at which the event started. This is as the sampling rate of the recording where 20 000 samples are taken per second.
  - **end_time**: This indicates the time at which the event ended. This is as the sampling rate of the recording where 20 000 samples are taken per second.
  - **collection_key**: This is the name of the recording session as it was in the raw data.
  - **subject**: This is the label of the mouse of which the recording was done.
  - **behavior_label**: This is the type of behaviour that was observed during the recording event.
  - **units**: This is the unit at which the behaviour was observed. This is a string of the unit name.
  - **cluster**: This is the cluster number that the unit event was assigned to.


- `03_cluster_relation_df.csv` - This File contains the results of the clustering comparison to known attributes. Each attribute is one of the columns in the `00_recording_event_times_labels.csv` file whereby the clusters could possibly form in. This file contains a **ARI** and **NMI** column. Each column represents a different measure of how well clsutering performed if one of the attreibutes are assumed to be the true labels. This file contains a summary of how well the recorded data alligns with other experimental factors.
