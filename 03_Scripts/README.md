# Scripts

This folder cotnains all the scripts required to run the analysis. The scripts are numbered in the order they should be run. The notebooks `00_Data_Extraction.ipynb`, `01_Data_Compression_DTW_Calculation.ipynb`, `02_Clustering.ipynb`, and `03_Result_Exploration.ipynb` each contain a header giving a brief description of what the script does, what it takes as inputs, what it produces as outputs and how long it may take to run.

The `multirecording_spikeanalysis.py` python script was uised to create the original raw data from data directly digested from the sensors. This script is included here as a reference if any deeper knowledge of hwo data was parsed is required. THis script also describes the structure of the raw data as it was saved as apython class variable made up of a dictionary of dictionaries.
